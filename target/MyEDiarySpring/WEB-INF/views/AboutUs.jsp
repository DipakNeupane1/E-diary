				<p class="image-aboutus-para">E-diary - A diary kept in
					electronic format You may already have tried to keep your own
					handwritten journal, but have you ever used an internet or online
					journal before? If not, you might would like to try as e-diaries
					have many benefits over regular paper diaries. An e-diary will
					never be full. Unlike paper diaries, they have not a limited number
					of pages or words your can put in them, and no inc will fade over
					time. E-diaries have become popular the last few years, and comes
					in many format and platforms. Desktop applications are available
					for MS-Windows or OS X (Mac), but over the last few years,
					Smartphones has revolutionized the concept. Our own e-diary products
					(WriteDiary.com and Diary with Lock), are only a small piece of the
					big e-journal picture. What are your e-diary requirements?
					Security: Not everybody, but most people like to have an option to
					secure their notes with a lock of some kind.Platform: Do you need an e-diary for a specific
					platform, like Android or iPhone, or maybe Windows or iMac? As your
					plattform may change over time, we recommend you to start using a
					electronic diary which can synchronize your notes between multiple
					platforms. This will give you more security and boost the
					availability of written texts. Synchronization: To be able to
					synchronize your notes between multiple devices is a *must have* in
					our opinion. Make sure that synchronization between devices is an
					available feature before you settle with a e-diary solution. Using
					a website solution is always safe, as all newer smartphones,
					tablets and personal computers can access the notes via a internet
					browser using regular HTML protocol. Offline support: You are not
					always connected to internet. </p>
					<p> An electronic journal that does not
					require and force you to always have wifi or internet access is
					preferred. You should be able to write and save a note even without
					internet access. Online support: On the other side, It is very neat
					to have an option to upload and share notes via internet. Storing
					your notes on a distributed system, is safer and can work as a very
					good security and backup feature.After all, you never know when an
					electronic device stop function, due to water-damage, lost or
					software bugs. Its always a good idea to keep an extra copy of your
					e-journal notes on a second device or server.</p>
